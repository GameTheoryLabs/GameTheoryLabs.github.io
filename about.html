                        David&#39;s a Gamepreneur with a broad array of market and technology experiences. This gives him a unique perspective in the disruptive emerging trend described as the Gamification of life and business. Prior to cofounding Game Theory Labs, his career has led him to build and market a myriad of innovative products and platforms across the tech Eco-system. He has worked for Hewlett Packard, Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems, Atari Games, Time Warner, Midway Games, IAC, Movea, Omnitrol Networks, as well as a myriad of startups and early-stage companies.
                    </p>
                        A highlight of his gaming experience was as the product manager for the hit Atari game San Francisco Rush which has earned well over $200 million dollars in franchise-wide revenue most of which was in quarters the original micro-transaction. Most recently, his experience includes producing an industry pioneering web service that combined self-publishing for game developers and social networking, as well as directing the marketing for the pioneering company in motion-sensing technology for consumer devices in computing, gaming, healthcare, and sports. His other technology experience includes designing mini-computers at HP Labs, developing desktop video strategy for Apple&#39;s Quicktime technology, and serving as an evangelist for Sun Microsystem&#39;s Java Consumer Technology.
                    <p>
                        He has a Masters degree in Business Administration from Stanford&#39;s Graduate School of Business and Bachelors of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from Arizona State University.

                        <br/>                        
                        Ph.D., MS, BS in Electrical Engineering from University of Texas at Arlington (UTA)
                        <br/>
                        Dr. Clark began his career in the US Navy as a Nuclear Electrician, where he maintained the electrical systems for Naval Nuclear Power Plant on the Nimitz Aircraft Carrier (CVN-68). &nbsp;After his honorable discharge from the Navy Dr. Clark pursued his BS, MS and PhD in Electrical Engineering from UTA. &nbsp;While earning his PhD Dr. Clark was as an Adjunct Professor for the Electrical Engineering Department at UTA. &nbsp;His MS thesis and PhD dissertation both focused on nanoscale modeling and simulations of growth kinetics for Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) for exotic materials such as Si/GaN heterogeneous super lattice structures. Upon completing his MS and PhD work Dr. Clark transitioned to industry and worked for an engineering firm as an R&amp;D Engineer and was Principal Investigator (PI) on multiple SBIR projects from DoD organizations (MDA, Army, Navy, NSF, etc). &nbsp;He successfully lead his development team and transitioned each project from Phase I discovery/proof of concept to Phase II commercialization development effort. &nbsp;Dr. Clark&#39;s previous SBIR PI experience includes: MDA funded (Phase I/II) flexible electronics system for the Airborne Laser (ABL) project that gave active devices high immunity to EMI and mechanical failures, Army funded (Phase I/II) reconfigurable self-healing mesh networked C4ISR single System on Chip (SoC) solution.

                        After a successful R&amp;D career Dr. Clark transitioned back to academia where he became a Professor of Game and Simulation Programming (GSP). &nbsp; Dr. Clark led the design of the program and created several of the courses (e.g. Advanced Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Graphics, Game Engine Architecture and Design, Simulation, 3D Physics Engine Development). &nbsp;While working in the GSP department Dr. Clark developed an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique (Field Theory (FiT) AI) that utilizes dynamic goal based strategies coupled with electromagnetic theory. &nbsp;He also developed GPU accelerated algorithms for simulation environments which have shown to produce a 20x performance increase over standard methods and can be executed in both native and web based environments.&nbsp;Dr. Clark has now transitioned back to industry and founded Game Theory Labs (GTL), a firm focused on developing high performance dynamically distributable cloud software for real-time analytics, simulation and gaming using HTML5 technology. &nbsp;The platforms developed at GTL (JaHOVA OS and GEn3CIS) have led Dr. Clark to be invited to speak at top conferences around the world on his innovative GPU accelerated and multithreading techniques in an HTML5/JavaScript environment. &nbsp;GTLs JavaScript HTML5 Online Virtual Application Operating System (JaHOVA OS) has been used in&nbsp;3D visualization of mastectomy/lumpectomy with dynamic generation of 3D cancer models from 2D imagery to assist both patient and doctor through the surgical process. &nbsp;GTLs Game Engine for 3D Complex Interactive Simulations (GEn3CIS) is currently being used to develop high fidelity simulations of Emergency Department loading to help decrease patient wait times.
